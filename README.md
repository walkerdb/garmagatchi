# Garmagotchi!

WIP

## Setup
1. Install the Garmin ConnectIQ SDK and follow its setup steps
2. Install Garmin's MonkeyC vscode extension
3. Set up a dev key by running the `Monkey C: Verify Installation` command from your vscode command pallette (cmd-shift-p). NOTE: you must save this file to the repo root.
4. Select `Run -> Run without debugging` to see the app show up on the watch sim!

## Development workflow
1. run `./dev.sh`
2. that's it! Your app will refresh in the sim after you make any change to the source files.
