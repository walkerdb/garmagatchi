# Garmagotchi!

WIP

## Setup

1. Install the Garmin ConnectIQ SDK and follow its [setup instructions](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/connect-iq-basics/getting-started/#theconnectiqsdkmanager)
2. Install Garmin's MonkeyC vscode extension
3. Set up a dev key by running the `Monkey C: Verify Installation` command from your vscode command pallette (cmd-shift-p). NOTE: you must save this file to the repo root.
4. Make the `connectiq` and `monkeyc` shell commands available by following the [setup instructions](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/reference-guides/monkey-c-command-line-setup/)
5. Run `./dev.sh` from your console to start everything up!

## Development workflow

1. run `./dev.sh`
2. that's it! Your app will refresh in the sim after you make any change to the source files.
