# Garmagotchi!

WIP

## Setup
1. Install the Garmin ConnectIQ SDK and follow its setup steps
2. Install Garmin's MonkeyC vscode extension
3. Set up a dev key by running the `Monkey C: Verify Installation` command from your vscode command pallette (cmd-shift-p)
4. Select `Run -> Run without debugging` to see the app show up on the watch sim!

## Development workflow
We're working on setting up something like hot reloading but for the moment you'll need to manually run the app via the run command whenever you make a change that you want to see on the device.
